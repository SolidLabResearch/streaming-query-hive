- Reliable execution across all frequencies

The **Fetching Client Side** approach provides:
- Competitive latency performance on M4
- Better memory efficiency at lower frequencies  
- Consistent and reliable execution

### Critical M4-Specific Findings
**Severe CPU Overutilization**: Both working approaches use 34-145 equivalent cores on a 10-core M4 system, indicating:
- Highly inefficient algorithms or implementation
- Potential for 10x+ performance improvement with proper M4 optimization
- Need for ARM64-specific code optimization and async processing patterns

**The Streaming Query Hive** approach has catastrophic performance issues requiring complete reimplementation.

### M4 Optimization Potential
The extreme CPU overutilization suggests these implementations are not optimized for modern ARM64 architecture. Proper M4 optimization could potentially:
- Reduce CPU usage by 80-90%
- Improve latency significantly  
- Enable much higher frequency processing
- Better utilize M4's performance/efficiency core architecture
