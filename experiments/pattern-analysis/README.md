# Experiments - Pattern Analysis

This directory contains experiments focused on analyzing different data patterns and oscillations.

## Files

- `experiment-complex-oscillation-comparison.js` - Compares approaches on complex oscillating data patterns
- `test-exponential-patterns.js` - Tests exponential growth and decay patterns

## Usage

These experiments test how well different approaches handle various data patterns including:
- Complex oscillations
- Exponential patterns
- Chaotic data patterns

Run these to evaluate pattern-specific performance characteristics.
