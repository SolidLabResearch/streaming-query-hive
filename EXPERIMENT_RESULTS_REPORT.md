## Conclusion

The experiments clearly demonstrate the fundamental trade-off between processing speed and computational accuracy in streaming query systems. The approximation approach offers excellent real-time performance with acceptable accuracy for most linear and gradual patterns, while struggling significantly with exponential and discontinuous functions. The fetching client side approach, when functional, provides exact results but suffers from performance and reliability issues.

For production systems, a hybrid approach leveraging the strengths of both methods would be optimal, with real-time approximation for monitoring and exact computation for critical validations.
