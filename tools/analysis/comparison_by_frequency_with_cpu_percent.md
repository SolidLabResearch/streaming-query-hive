# Comparative Results â€” per frequency (with CPU % of 10-core M4)

Assumptions:
- CPU percent is estimated as described below. For `independent` we computed percent from CPU delta across resource CSVs per iteration. For other approaches we used a heuristic: percent = (avgCPUTotal / assumed_duration_ms) / cores * 100, with assumed_duration_ms = 68134 ms and cores = 10.
- Treat streaming-query-hive raw CPU numbers with caution; units may differ.
