# Independent vs Streaming Query Approaches - Comprehensive Comparison

## Executive Summary

The independent approach shows higher resource usage (memory and CPU) compared to other streaming query approaches, with slightly higher latency. However, data quality varies significantly by frequency, with some high-frequency measurements being unreliable due to low sample counts.

## Resource Scaling Analysis

### Memory Usage Trends
- **4Hz-16Hz (reliable data):** Independent consistently uses 2-2.5x more RSS memory
- **32Hz+ (unreliable):** Memory usage appears to scale exponentially, suggesting memory leaks or inefficient scaling

### CPU Usage Trends  
- **4Hz:** Independent: 0.59% vs others ~0.5%
- **8Hz:** Independent: 1.59% vs others ~0.7%
- **16Hz:** Independent: 2.40% vs others ~1.1%
- Shows roughly linear scaling with frequency

### Latency Performance
- Independent consistently shows 4-7% higher latency than approximation approach
- Latency overhead appears to increase slightly with frequency

- Independent processing streams

### ‚ùå Disadvantages of Independent Approach
1. **Higher Memory Usage:** 2-2.5x more RSS memory at reliable frequencies
2. **Higher CPU Usage:** 2-3x more CPU utilization
3. **Higher Latency:** 4-7% longer time to first result
4. **Scaling Issues:** Potential memory scaling problems at high frequencies
5. **Data Quality:** Unreliable measurements at 32Hz+ due to low sample counts

## Recommendations

1. **For Production:** Use approximation-approach for best performance
2. **For Independent Approach:** 
   - Investigate memory leaks at high frequencies
   - Re-run experiments at 32Hz+ with more iterations for reliable data
   - Optimize memory allocation patterns
3. **For Streaming-Query-Hive:** Investigate CPU measurement anomalies
