# Analysis - Comparison Tools

This directory contains scripts for comparing results across different approaches and experiments.

## Files

- `analyze-exponential-data.js` - Analyzes exponential pattern data across approaches
- `extract-and-compare-results.js` - Extracts and compares experimental results
- `extract-unified-averages.js` - Computes unified averages across all experiments
- `create_simple_comparison_table.js` - Creates comparison tables for results

## Usage

These scripts are typically run after experiments complete to analyze and compare the performance of different approaches (approximation vs. fetching client-side).
