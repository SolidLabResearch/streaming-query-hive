# Folder Structure Cleanup Summary

## What Was Cleaned Up

### 1. Root Directory Cleanup
- **BEFORE**: Test files scattered in root (`test-parallel-execution.js`, `test-parallel-execution-local.js`)
- **AFTER**: Moved to `test/legacy/` directory

### 2. Analysis Files Consolidation
- **BEFORE**: Duplicate analysis files in `analysis/`, `scripts/analysis-js/`, and `experiments/`
- **AFTER**: Consolidated under `tools/` with logical separation:
  - `tools/analysis/` - Analysis scripts
  - `tools/experiments/` - Experiment runners
  - `tools/legacy-analysis/` - Historical analysis files

### 3. Experiment Organization
- **BEFORE**: Scattered experiment files in multiple locations
- **AFTER**: Organized under `tools/experiments/` with sub-categories

### 4. Support Files Organization
- **BEFORE**: `temp-data/`, `logs/`, `tests/` scattered in root
- **AFTER**: Moved to appropriate locations:
  - `tools/temp-results/` - Temporary data files
  - `tools/experiment-logs/` - Historical experiment logs
  - `test/unit/` - Unit tests

### 5. Script Organization
- **BEFORE**: Mixed Python and JavaScript scripts in `scripts/`
- **AFTER**: 
  - `tools/scripts/` - Python utility scripts
  - `tools/analysis-py/` - Python analysis scripts
  - `scripts/` - Build/utility scripts (clean)

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Clear Separation of Concerns**: Source code, tests, tools, and configuration are clearly separated
2. **Reduced Duplication**: Eliminated duplicate analysis files that existed in multiple locations
3. **Logical Organization**: Related files are grouped together logically
4. **Clean Root Directory**: No more scattered test files or temporary data in root
5. **Tool Consolidation**: All development tools are under the `tools/` directory
6. **Better Maintainability**: Easier to find and maintain files with clear structure

## Impact on Development

- **Core Development**: Work continues in `src/` and `examples/` as before
- **Testing**: All test files now properly organized in `test/`
- **Analysis**: All analysis tools consolidated under `tools/`
- **Build Process**: Unchanged - project still compiles and runs correctly
- **Examples**: Working demos remain functional

## Files Processed

- **Moved**: ~50+ analysis and experiment files
- **Consolidated**: Duplicate files from 3 different locations
- **Organized**: Test files, logs, temporary data
- **Cleaned**: Root directory of scattered files

The folder structure is now clean, logical, and maintainable while preserving all functionality.
